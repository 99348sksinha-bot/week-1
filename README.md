#Weekly Progress Report â€“ Week 1

During the first week of the project, I focused on dataset selection and preprocessing. I started by identifying and selecting a suitable dataset related to my project domain. After downloading the dataset, I explored its structure, including the number of records, features, and types of data available.

Once the dataset was understood, I carried out preprocessing steps to prepare it for further analysis. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing inconsistent entries. I also performed basic transformations such as encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical values where necessary. These steps helped in improving the data quality and ensured that the dataset is ready for the next phase of analysis and model building.
